# Quenderin

> From intent → immutable, reviewable code.
> A local, deterministic generator for developers who refuse to surrender their source.

## What It Is

Quenderin is **not** a framework, a platform, or a magic black box. It is a **local compiler-level toolchain** that:

1.  Reads your existing schema (Prisma, Drizzle, SQL, or plain TypeScript).
2.  Consumes natural-language prompts stored as version-controlled markdown.
3.  Generates plain source files into a `.gitignore`-safe `src/gen/` directory.
4.  Runs **entirely offline** using a pinned, local LLM to guarantee **bit-for-bit reproducibility.**

You are trading the time it takes to write tedious boilerplate for the time it takes to review a well-structured pull request.

## The Workflow

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm i -g quenderin

# Point to your schema and scaffold config
quenderin init

# Describe a feature in plain english
quenderin add "Stripe checkout with Apple Pay, EU VAT, and SCA"
````

The tool opens a pull request with small, atomic commits (e.g., `feat(gen): add types`, `feat(gen): add resolver`, `feat(gen): add tests`).

Approve → merge → ship. The generated code is ephemeral **by default**.

## Core Guarantees & Trade-offs

This tool is built to answer the hard questions of code generation.

| Promise | The Reality (How It Works) |
|---|---|
| **Deterministic Output** | The default LLM is a bundled 7B GGUF model, pinned to a specific SHA hash. Same schema + same prompt → identical output, forever. No drift. |
| **Manageable Reviews** | PRs are automatically split into small, logical commits, with a hard limit of \~300 lines per PR. No 3,000-line monoliths. |
| **Safe Manual Edits** | The "ejection problem" is solved via `quenderin freeze src/gen/checkout.ts`. This moves the file to `src/handwritten/`, rewrites all imports, and tells the generator to never touch it again. You are always in control. |
| **No Context Explosion** | The CLI fails if local context exceeds a safe token budget. You guide context discovery with explicit `--include` and `--exclude` globs in your config. |
| **No Hidden Runtime** | Zero network calls after initial installation. Zero telemetry unless you explicitly opt-in. It runs on your machine, period. |

## Visible Dependency Graph

Each generated file is annotated with its dependencies. You can visualize the impact of a change before you make it.

```typescript
// src/gen/checkout/resolver.ts
// Generated by prompt: stripe-checkout.md
// Depends on: schema.User, src/lib/auth.ts
// Consumers: src/pages/api/checkout.ts
```

Run `quenderin deps <file>` to output a Mermaid diagram of its local dependencies.

## Economics

The default, offline model means the cost is fixed.

| Scenario | Generated Tokens / month | Cloud API Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Any project size | Unlimited | **$0** |

You can optionally configure your own API key for a larger cloud model, but it is not required.
